### Difference between _Git Pull_ and _Git Clone_

`Git Clone`: When there is no repository in local, then download the repository from remote.  
`Git Pull`: When there is repository in local, if there is new __Commit__ in remote repository, then download and merge it the new __Commit__ with local file.
